# BMI_CALCULATOR
Welcome to the BMI Calculator, a simple Python script that calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your height and weight.

## About
The BMI Calculator is a straightforward project designed to help you quickly estimate your BMI, which is a measure of body fat based on your height and weight. This can be useful for monitoring your health and fitness goals.

## How it Works

1. When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter your height in meters (m) and your weight in kilograms (kg).

2. The script will then calculate your BMI using the formula:

   ```markdown
   BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) ^ 2)
3. It will round the calculated BMI to the nearest whole number.
4. Finally, it will display your BMI, which can help you assess your general health based on common BMI categories.

## Example
Input Example : <br>

```
enter your height in m: 1.75
enter your weight in kg: 68
```
In this input example, the user enters their height as 1.75 meters and their weight as 68 kilograms.<br>


Output Example: <br>
```
Your BMI is: 22
```
In this output example, the script calculates the user's BMI as 22, rounding it to the nearest whole number. Based on the BMI categories mentioned earlier:

- A BMI of 22 falls into the "Normal Weight" category.
 
     
## BMI Categories
- BMI less than 18.5: Underweight
- BMI between 18.5 and 24.9: Normal Weight
- BMI between 25.0 and 29.9: Overweight
- BMI 30.0 or greater: Obesity

  ## This program demonstrates how to:
- Take user input
- Perform calculations
- Format and print output
